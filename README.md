# LaLiga Match Winner Prediction (2016–2024)

This project aims to create a **Machine Learning model** capable of predicting the winner of LaLiga matches based on historical data from the 2016 to 2024 seasons.

The project is organized into multiple phases, each focusing on a key step in the process.

## 📌 Phases
1. **Data Extraction** – Scraping match data from Transfermarkt.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, formatting dates, encoding teams, etc.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creating meaningful features (home advantage, recent form, goals average, etc.).
4. **Model Training** – Building and training ML models to predict match outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation & Deployment** – Assessing model accuracy and preparing for deployment.
